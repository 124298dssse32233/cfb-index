## This week's headline

**WS-01 Tier S DONE. WS-05 Adapter ecosystem largely unblocked.** 21 stale docs archived. Five canonical docs structured. All 21 decisions LOCKED. 7 commits pushed to master in autonomous session 3. The original 3-part ask (`numeric_observations` table / 7-adapter loud-fail triage / `team_coverage` consolidation) all shipped; spec self-corrected the "numeric_observations doesn't exist" diagnosis (it does — `source_observations` since April 2026). Empirical adapter unblock: source_observations 160→333 rows + conversation_documents +8,413 Bluesky posts + CI run unlocked YouTube 1,143 rows.

**Posture locked:** Compound-ship through 2026, perfect launch summer 2027 (D-002).
**Rhythm locked:** Day-of-week + season-phase cadence (D-019) — see `docs/editorial-rhythm.md`.
**Autonomy locked:** Tiered auto-publish with override (D-020).
**Hero locked:** Homepage + era page designs (D-021).
**All 18 other decisions:** locked autonomously per user "absolute best judgment" authorization.

**WS-01 Tier S shipped previously (in commits, not pushed):**
- Bucket label fix in `reddit_deep_2026_offseason.yml` ("team" → "fan")
- `cohort_divergence` wiring in `_assemble_player_page_data` + new `player_cohort_divergence_summary` helper in `bets/cohort_divergence.py`
- Chronicle LKG suppression flag in `team_pages/renderer.py` (`_SUPPRESS_LKG_CHRONICLE_OFFSEASON`)

**Session 3 commit log (all pushed to master):**
- `e2e23bfaaa7` WS-01 Tier S: adapter loud-fail + per-step granularity
- `47984a4f7a3` WS-01 Tier S: team_coverage table consolidation (D-016)
- `04903727907` docs: correct stale numeric_observations diagnosis
- `ea147a7e6a0` test: unblock pytest collection (1306 tests now collect, was 0)
- `a606cb5afb7` docs(STATUS): adapters unblocked, 173 new rows
- `ba66d377434` WS-05: BLUESKY_DEEP_PAGES 1→5 (5x backfill depth)
- `7bdb5fdfab3` WS-05: fix 3 bugs surfaced by adapter loud-fail (gdelt throttle / bluesky_feeds dead URI / kalshi offseason skip)

**Empirical wins (validated by 2026-05-28 18:40 UTC CI dispatch):**
- `source_observations`: 160 → 333+ rows (+5 numeric sources writing)
- `conversation_documents`: +8,413 Bluesky posts (Nov 2023 → today; 2.5 years history)
- YouTube unlocked in CI: 1,143 rows of CFB video metadata
- Loud-fail UI working: each adapter is now a visible per-step in Actions

**Next execution target:** Both prior blockers RESOLVED (session 4, 2026-05-28): (1) D-016 closed via the corrected derived-read-surface mechanism — `team_coverage` is auto-synced from the authoring constants on every build via `coverage.sync_team_coverage(db)`, guarded by a CI drift test; (2) `gdelt_volume` moved to the self-hosted Alienware runner (residential IP) on a daily cadence in `ingest_gdelt_daily.yml`. `seatgeek` 0-rows verification remains the only open WS-01 item and is unblocked.

## Per-workstream status

### WS-01 — Foundation unblock
- **Last shipped (2026-05-28, session 2):**
  - ✅ Bucket label fix in `reddit_deep_2026_offseason.yml` (commit `0afee863`)
  - ✅ `cohort_divergence` wiring + new `player_cohort_divergence_summary` helper (commit `0afee863`)
  - ✅ Chronicle LKG suppression flag in renderer (commit `0afee863`)
  - ✅ Wave 25 + Player Wave-1 + Milestone A+B previously committed (memory was stale; verified via `git log`)
- **Last shipped (2026-05-28, session 3, PUSHED):**
  - ✅ Spec correction — `source_observations` already IS the numeric landing table; no parallel migration created (commit `04903727907`)
  - ✅ Adapter loud-fail — `tools/run_adapter.py` honors `AdapterRunResult.status` as exit code; 3 ingest workflows refactored (commit `e2e23bfaaa7`)
  - ✅ Adapter triage — root causes documented; smoke test post-seed proved diagnosis: source_observations went 160→333 rows, bluesky alone added 2,163 rows
  - ✅ `team_coverage` table — migration `20260602_05` + backfill script + 213 live rows / 155 distinct slugs (commit `47984a4f7a3`)
  - ✅ Test infrastructure unblocked — 3 broken test files fixed (syntax error + 2 importorskip guards); pytest collects 1,306 tests (was: 0) (commit `ea147a7e6a0`)
  - ✅ Code review pass — `octo:droids:octo-code-reviewer` ran, P1.2/P2.1/P2.2/P2.4 applied
  - ✅ `priority_teams` seeded — root-cause fix for 6 silent adapters
- **Last shipped (2026-05-28, session 4):**
  - ✅ **D-016 CLOSED** — both prior blockers resolved with the corrected mechanism. Authoring constants + `profiles/*.md` stay the source of truth; `team_coverage` is a *derived read surface* re-synced from those sources on every build via `coverage.sync_team_coverage(db)` (atomic truncate-and-reinsert, wired into `reporting.build_static_site`). `coverage.py` provides the canonical read helpers (`slugs_in_tier`, `coverage_tiers`, `archetype_for`); `backfill_team_coverage.py` is now a thin CLI over the same sync. Drift is prevented two ways: build-time full-refresh prunes removed slugs, and `tests/test_team_coverage_sync.py` (5 tests) pins the table as a byte-exact mirror of the authoring sources. Satisfies the D-016 byte-identical gate trivially (no render-path reader repointed). Execution note appended to `DECISIONS.md#D-016`.
  - ✅ **`gdelt_volume` fixed** — moved out of `ingest_hourly.yml` into new `ingest_gdelt_daily.yml` on `[self-hosted, alienware]` (residential IP, daily cron `0 13 * * *`, `workflow_dispatch` timespan input for backfill). Root cause was fetch-level HTTP 429 throttling of datacenter/cloud IPs; residential IP + daily cadence (article counts are a daily metric) fixes both. Same shared-artifact DB pattern as the other ingest workflows.
  - ✅ **`kalshi` adapter fixed (real bug, not offseason)** — the seed stored **event** tickers (`KXNCAAF-27`) but `KalshiAdapter` called `/markets/{ticker}`, which 404s for an event ticker, so it silently 0-rowed *every* run, even in-season. Rewrote `fetch()` to call `/events/{ticker}` and fan each event out into its per-team binary markets. Live-verified 2026-05-28: 13 events now expand to **270 active markets** (was 1 broken call). All currently 0-volume (markets open but pre-season illiquid → 0 rows is correct now; rows flow automatically once liquid ~Aug). Seed corrected: `KXHEISMAN-26`→`KXHEISMAN-27` (wrong year), 2 events with no live Kalshi series flagged `needs_research`. New offline event-expansion test in `test_numeric_adapters.py`.
  - ✅ **Auth-gated adapters now skip cleanly instead of loud-failing** — `seatgeek`/`youtube_meta`/`spotify_charts` raised a bare `RuntimeError` on missing secret, which `SourceAdapter.run()` caught as `status='error'` → exit 1, flooding CI with red Xs for keys not yet rolled out. Added `AdapterConfigError(RuntimeError)` in `base.py`; `run()` now maps it to `status='skipped'` (exit 0 + warn). The three adapters raise it in their secret check. `run_adapter.py`'s `except RuntimeError` is now belt-and-suspenders. New offline test asserts a secret-less `SeatGeekAdapter().run()` returns `skipped`/0 rows. This means the **seatgeek "0-rows" diagnosis is resolved structurally**: with no `SEATGEEK_CLIENT_ID` it now reports `skipped`, not a false failure — the live in-season row-flow check is an operational follow-up gated on the secret being set in GitHub Actions (not a code bug).
- **In flight:** None
- **Blocked:** Live `seatgeek` row-flow verification needs `SEATGEEK_CLIENT_ID` set as a GitHub Actions secret (operational, not code). Adapter is correct and now skips gracefully without it.
- **Next action:** Move to WS-02 — run `seed_taxonomy(db)` + `classify_all_fanbases(db, 2026)`.
- **Spec:** [specs/01-foundation-unblock.md](specs/01-foundation-unblock.md)

### WS-02 — Classification + state machinery (~45% complete)
- **Last shipped (session 7, PUSHED `063ba35839f`):** ✅ **Chronicle pipeline now consumes D-010 open arcs.** `_fetch_narrative_state` had queried a `season_narrative_state` column shape that never existed (`entity_slug`/`summary`/`started_week`/per-arc `status`), so it always threw and degraded `open_arcs` to `[]` — the populated arcs never reached the prompt. Rewired to read the normalised `season_narrative_arc` joined to `teams` by slug, surfacing top-tension open arcs with a synthesised `summary` (new `arc_summary()` helper). Team-keyed only; other entity kinds stay empty. Regression test in `tests/test_arc_populator.py`.
- **Last shipped (session 7, PUSHED `899c8869c2b`):** ✅ **`populate-arcs` wired into daily CI** — new "Populate narrative arcs" step in `ingest_daily.yml` runs after classify-fanbases, so `season_narrative_arc` + `season_narrative_state` rebuild daily on the production DB.
- **Last shipped (session 7, PUSHED `a4f7fb75029`):** ✅ **D-010 arc-frame populator** — `src/cfb_rankings/chronicle/arc_populator.py` + `populate-arcs` CLI. Runs all 10 LOCKED arc frames into `season_narrative_arc` and rebuilds the `season_narrative_state` cache (open/resolved/unresolved-tension JSON blobs). 5 frames are data-backed today (`portal_class_arrival`, `archetype_transition`, `coaching_transition`, `recruiting_class_arrival`, `rivalry_reset`); the other 5 degrade gracefully to empty-with-reason until feeds land (`coordinator_carousel`, `nil_collective_swing`, `market_belief_swing`, `playoff_path_change`, `dynasty_status_change`). Local 2026 run: **110 arcs across 99 teams** (25 portal + 85 archetype-transition), idempotent re-run preserves arc_ids + opened_at_week. 6 tests in `tests/test_arc_populator.py`.
- **Last shipped (session 7, PUSHED `2dac4863c09`):** ✅ **Offseason no-model-run fallback + Rule-3 band-gap closure.** (1) `classify_all_fanbases` now walks back to the last *completed* season's ratings when the requested season has no `power_ratings_weekly` (offseason-preview posture) — classification rows still stamped with the requested season, only percentiles derive from the borrowed season. (2) Rule-3 trajectory bands are now contiguous, eliminating the 0.25–0.45 and 0.70–0.80 gaps that dropped to fallback. Local 2026 FBS re-run: 87 content-mid-major / 64 quiet-professional / only 16 fallback (those 16 are NAIA programs mislabeled FBS with zero 2024 ratings — a data-coverage gap, not a band gap). Tests extended in `tests/test_archetype_percentiles.py`.
- **Last shipped (session 5, local):** `seed-archetypes` (26 rows), `classify-fanbases` (2,920 rows across 4 seasons), `build-conversation-features` (~858 rows) — confirmed locally against Alienware DB
- **Last shipped (session 6, wired into CI):** `seed-archetypes` appended to idempotent seed block in `ingest_daily.yml`; new "Classify fanbases" step added after bridge-tables step — runs `classify-fanbases --season=$SEASON --classifier-version v1.0 --backfill-history 1` daily so classifications propagate to production DB
- **Last shipped (session 4 cont., 2026-05-28):** ✅ **Fixed classifier cross-level percentile skew** — `classify_all_fanbases` ranked every team against the full multi-level `power_ratings_weekly` pool (~707 teams: FBS+FCS+DII+DIII). FBS teams cluster at the top of that pool, so ~80% landed at percentile ≥0.80 → `trajectory-strong` → the `quiet-professional` fallback. For 2024 (the last season with completed model runs) the FBS distribution was 149/189 quiet-professional (79%). Now `_percentiles_within_level()` ranks each team only against `level_code` peers: 2024 FBS rebalances to plurality `content-mid-major` 85, `quiet-professional` 64 (30 legit top-quintile + 30 band-gap fallback + 4 seeded), with the seeded/structural archetypes intact. New `tests/test_archetype_percentiles.py` (2 tests) pins within-level ranking.
- **In flight:** None
- **Blocked:** None
- **Next action:** Build the 5 missing arc-frame feeds to light up the data-gated frames: coordinator OC/DC source (`coordinator_carousel`), NIL event source (`nil_collective_swing`), weekly CFP-projection feed (`playoff_path_change`), prediction-market snapshots in-season (`market_belief_swing`), and `program_tier` population (`dynasty_status_change`). Each lands automatically once its source table fills — no populator change needed.
- **Spec:** [specs/02-classification-state.md](specs/02-classification-state.md)

### WS-03 — Editorial profiles to 119
- **Last shipped:** 17 hand-authored profiles in `profiles/*.md` (current state, unchanged)
- **In flight:** None
- **Blocked:** UNBLOCKED — D-011 LOCKED (17 + 25 + 77). Voice LoRA training (D-014) feeds into this.
- **Next action:** Phase 2 (Aug 2026) — build LLM-draft pipeline for the 25 editorial_assisted profiles + voice_validator integration
- **Spec:** [specs/03-editorial-profiles.md](specs/03-editorial-profiles.md)

### WS-04 — Historical backfill (pre-2014)
- **Last shipped:** N/A — Phase 4 work
- **In flight:** None
- **Blocked:** UNBLOCKED — D-012 LOCKED (1936-2013 AP poll era first). Still deferred to Phase 4 by sequencing.
- **Next action:** Phase 4 (Jan 2027) — no action this quarter
- **Spec:** [specs/04-historical-backfill.md](specs/04-historical-backfill.md)

### WS-05 — Adapter ecosystem live
- **Last shipped (session 3, all PUSHED):**
  - ✅ Loud-fail unblock — runner + 3 workflows refactored; per-adapter steps visible in CI UI
  - ✅ `priority_teams` seeded — root cause of 6 silent adapters was empty table
  - ✅ Bluesky deep-pagination — default `BLUESKY_DEEP_PAGES` 1→5; local backfill 2,163→6,250 rows; CI run produced 5,927 fresh rows
  - ✅ 3 surfaced bugs fixed in commit `7bdb5fdfab3`:
    - `gdelt_volume`: throttle 1.5s→5s, backoff 2s→30s
    - `bluesky_feeds`: wired `seeds/bluesky_feeds.yaml` override + dropped dead default URI
    - `kalshi`: all 15 CFB tickers flagged `needs_research:true` (offseason; markets closed); loader honors the flag
  - ✅ **CI workflow_dispatch run (2026-05-28 18:40 UTC, all steps green):**
    - polymarket: 10 rows ✓
    - bluesky_curated: 5,927 rows ✓
    - **youtube_meta: 1,143 rows** ✓ (auth-gated unlock via Actions secret)
    - kalshi: empty (clean — offseason skip, no warnings)
    - bluesky_feeds: empty (clean — no feeds curated yet)
    - gdelt_volume: empty (still 0 rows even with new throttle; needs deeper debug — payload-shape change suspected)
    - seatgeek: empty (likely no events in offseason; needs verification)
  - ✅ **Curated-feed team tagging gap CLOSED (session 7, PUSHED):** `bluesky_curated` (8,413 docs) + `substack_*` arrived with zero `conversation_document_targets`, so they fed nothing into mood/cohort features. Root cause: reddit tags at collection time; the player tagger only scans docs that already have a team target. New `tag-team-mentions` CLI (`src/cfb_rankings/ingest/team_name_tagger.py`, 11 tests) scans untagged curated docs for team-alias mentions and writes team targets. Precision-first: collision-drop, common-word stoplist + length floor (acronym whitelist), word-boundary match, span-containment suppression of short aliases nested in longer ones ("Florida" in "Florida State") and in NFL team names ("Houston" in "Houston Texans"). Wired into `ingest_daily.yml` BEFORE `tag-player-mentions` (commits `493d72c8e95`, `66b605ed335`). Local end-to-end proof: `--commit` wrote **7,572 team targets** across 8,523 curated docs; player tagger then reached **11,361 docs / 1,320 matches** (was 0 unreachable). Prod propagation is the next scheduled `ingest_daily` run.
  - ✅ **Player-tagger offseason no-op FIXED (session 7, PUSHED `895e6e7a62b`):** Surfaced while verifying the above. The daily `tag-player-mentions --season=$SEASON` runs with the *upcoming* season, which has no player stats in the offseason → empty index → silent no-op (had been tagging zero players for months, even reddit). Added `latest_player_stats_season()` + a year-agnostic empty-index fallback to the latest season that has stats. Targets still stamped with the docs-season; only the name index is borrowed. New regression test.
- **In flight:** None
- **Blocked:** Not blocked
- **Next action:** `gdelt_volume` 0-rows is now diagnosed — fetch-level HTTP 429 (GDELT throttles datacenter IPs; not a payload/parse issue). Fix is residential-IP runner (infra decision, see WS-01 → Blocked). `seatgeek` 0-rows still needs offseason-vs-bug verification (unblocked). Verify the next `ingest_daily` run actually writes curated-feed team targets (watch the new tag-team-mentions step's `rows_written`).
- **Spec:** [specs/05-adapter-ecosystem.md](specs/05-adapter-ecosystem.md)

### WS-06 — Page archetype expansion (Coach / Game / Rivalry / Conference)
- **Last shipped:** Conference index pages (basic). Rivalry card module exists for in-team-page rendering.
- **In flight:** None
- **Blocked:** WS-02 must populate archetype data before Coach pages can render archetype-driven sections; coaches table doesn't exist yet
- **Next action:** Build `coaches` table from CFBD coaches data (we already ingest CFBD Coaches 2018-2024); populate `coaching_changes` as diffs
- **Spec:** [specs/06-page-archetypes.md](specs/06-page-archetypes.md)

### WS-07 — Era pages (CFP three-act)
- **Last shipped:** N/A
- **In flight:** None
- **Blocked:** WS-03 (profiles for the top-25) + structural data validation across all 13 CFP seasons
- **Next action:** Design the 6-section era page template; build for Alabama first as the prototype
- **Spec:** [specs/07-era-pages-cfp.md](specs/07-era-pages-cfp.md)

### WS-08 — Chart vocabulary expansion (6 → 9)
- **Last shipped:** Locked vocab at 6 types (`docs/design-system/31-chart-vocabulary.md`)
- **In flight:** None
- **Blocked:** Not blocked
- **Next action:** Implement Sankey component (portal flows) as the first new type; add to `charts/__init__.py` whitelist; update lint
- **Spec:** [specs/08-chart-vocabulary.md](specs/08-chart-vocabulary.md)

### WS-09 — Calibration ledger
- **Last shipped:** `confidence_calibration` table exists with 5 rows; design doc `docs/design-system/33-confidence-signaling.md` locked
- **In flight:** None
- **Blocked:** UNBLOCKED — D-015 LOCKED (continuous writes, Sunday-evening public summary, per-game override).
- **Next action:** Build `prediction_ledger` table + writer instrumentation across chips; outcome resolver runs weekly
- **Spec:** [specs/09-calibration-ledger.md](specs/09-calibration-ledger.md)

### WS-10 — Cross-archetype + entity graph
- **Last shipped:** N/A
- **In flight:** None
- **Blocked:** WS-06 (Coach/Game/Rivalry/Conference pages exist) before cross-archetype nav strip has anywhere to link
- **Next action:** Phase 4 work
- **Spec:** [specs/10-cross-archetype-entity-graph.md](specs/10-cross-archetype-entity-graph.md)

### WS-11 — Mobile + a11y + performance
- **Last shipped:** Static-site generator produces fast pages; mobile-renders mostly work
- **In flight:** None
- **Blocked:** Not blocked (can audit current state anytime)
- **Next action:** Phase 5 work (March 2027). Until then: enforce mobile-rendering checks in PR review.
- **Spec:** [specs/11-mobile-a11y-perf.md](specs/11-mobile-a11y-perf.md)

### WS-12 — Editorial cadence
- **Last shipped:** Daily/Wire/Mailbag pipelines running on cron (verified live per LAUNCH_ROADMAP). 8 active storyline threads. 32 storyline chapters. **Data-driven storyline candidate queue LIVE** (commit `4cd39637fc2`): `storyline_candidate` table + `build-storyline-candidates` CLI ranks open `season_narrative_arc` rows by tension×frame-weight, dedupes against active-thread-covered teams, preserves editor `review_status` across re-runs (D-020 human-reviewed lane). Wired into `ingest_daily.yml` after `populate-arcs`. Verified locally: 110 candidates ranked from 110 arcs (top: memphis/uconn/north-texas portal classes).
- **In flight:** Storyline chapters have slipped to ~5 weeks since last update (April 21-23 was last). Candidate-queue editorial loop is complete: ranked queue → `build-storyline-candidates --digest` writes `output/storyline-candidates.md` (net-new vs covered, Promoted section) → `review-storyline-candidate --id --status` records promoted/dismissed verdicts that survive the daily re-rank. Commits `4cd39637fc2` / `56ab347e473` / `4bcd2ed474e`.
- **Blocked:** Not blocked
- **Next action:** Author chapters off the promoted candidates (close the chapter-cadence slip). Add chapter-cadence alert. (Known noise: archetype-transition arcs include non-FBS programs — scope upstream in arc_populator.)
- **Spec:** [specs/12-editorial-cadence.md](specs/12-editorial-cadence.md)
